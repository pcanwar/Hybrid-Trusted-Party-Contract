# Hybrid Trusted Party Contract Agrees on Clients Input

A hybrid-trusted multi-party contract to identify the input of a client and validate a transaction. 

This means that in order to use the smart contract, more than a client (seller and buyer) is required to provide their own trusted parties as authenticated users, so each client has to belong to a different party. The party is assigned to tie authorized users together logically. The input data can be a product, service and etc.
